I am currently a graduate student in Biostatistics and Data Science at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu). I accepted a high-intensity programming training in R and Python, which enables me to deal with extensive datasets through cleaning, transforming, and integrating datasets, especially in the healthcare field, and generate informative analysis efficiently. I am looking forward to getting or sharing fantastic ideas with you!
